<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davisbetancourt"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a recent graduate with a strong interest in technology and hands-on problem solving. I enjoy understanding how systems work, improving security, and finding practical solutions to real-world technical challenges. I’m always learning, experimenting, and building projects to sharpen my skills and grow as a professional.

## Objective
My journey in computer networking and cybersecurity has helped me build a strong interest in protecting systems and data. I am now motivated to move into the cybersecurity field, with the goal of starting my career in a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can monitor threats, learn from real incidents, and grow my skills in a practical environment.
